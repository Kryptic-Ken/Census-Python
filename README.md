# Census-Python
This repository contains one of my previous assignments that I had during my first semester of college. The goal of this assignment was to work in a collaborative team of 3 to create a program that would import CSV files that contained population data; the program would also sort &amp; list the data given the user's choice and also show calculations of the data. Another part of the assignment was to create flowcharts in the initial phase of creating the program.
